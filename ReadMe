Solution:

To make sure the last a few numbers will not repeat, i determined 
i had to have some structure to avoid it.

1. 	More frequent numbers from (1, 2, ..., 11, 12) always appear together.
	e.g. (4,3,5,1,6,2,8,10,9,7,11,12)

2.	Only one of the less frequent numbers from (13, 14, ..., 19, 20)  
	is mixed in with more frequent numbers, after the completion of  
	the dataset.

3. 	Step 1: After 42 instances of the dataset then a single less frequency  
			number is generated.
	
	Step 2: Once all the less frequent numbers are gone, then generate the 
			rest of the more frequency numbers.
			
			
	e.g.    	4,3,5,1,6,2,8,10,9,7,11,12, ] 
			.                           ]
			.                           ]  42 more frequent numbers dataset
			.                           ]    
			6,3,5,1,4,12,8,11,9,7,10,2, ]
			15,                            a single less frequent number
		        8,3,12,1,11,2,4,10,9,7,6,5, ] 
			.                           ]
			.                           ]  42 more frequent numbers dataset
			.                           ] 
			1,3,5,2,6,2,12,10,9,7,11,8,
		    13,                            a single less frequent number
			.
			.
			.    until all the less frequent numbers are gone,
			.    then generate the rest of the more frequent numbers.
			.
			.
			11,4,5,12,7,10,9,8,1,3,2,6, ] 
			.                           ]
			.                           ] 1502 more frequent numbers dataset
			.                           ]    
			1,3,5,6,4,2,8,11,9,7,10,12, ]
